    <h2>This is best bread ever!</h2>
    <p>For amateur and pro bakers alike, there's no recipe more appropriate for St. Patrick's Day than Irish Soda bread. Irish heritage optional.</p>
    <p><strong>Irish soda bread</strong> is one of those unicorn recipes that's hard to mess up and can withstand seemingly countless variations. While professionals will surely put a special flourish on their loaf, Irish soda bread is <em>excellent</em> for novices since there's no intimidating yeast, no rising, practically no kneading, and no fancy shaping to worry about. Just mix, quickly knead, dump onto a baking sheet or cast iron pan, and bake.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups raisins (I used 2 cups currants)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon caraway seeds</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1¼ cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Grease a 9-inch round cast iron skillet or a 9-inch round baking or cake pan.</li>
        <li> In a mixing bowl, combine flour (reserving 1 tablespoon), sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, raisins (or currants), and caraway seeds. In a small bowl, blend eggs, buttermilk and sour cream. Stir the liquid mixture into flour mixture just until flour is moistened.</li>
        <li>Knead dough in bowl about 10 to 12 strokes. Dough will be sticky. Place the dough in the prepared skillet or pan and pat down. Cut a 4x¾-inch deep slit in the top of the bread. Dust with reserved flour.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 65 to 75 minutes. Let cool and turn bread onto a wire rack.</li>
